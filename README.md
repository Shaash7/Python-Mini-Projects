In this repository of mini-project there are various python mini-projects like:
1. Generating Qrcode using Python and 2. Sketchify.
The first project is a mini-project where I have used qrcode library of Python to generate qrcode of any data, similarly in the second mini-project I have named it as sketchify because here a colour image is converting into its black & white sketch by using libraries like OpenCV and Imageio.
