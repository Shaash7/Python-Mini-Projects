In this repository there are various python mini-projects like
1. Generating Qrcode using Python
2. Sketchify.
In the first project, I have used qrcode library of Python to generate qrcode of any data. 
Similarly, in the second mini-project I have named it as sketchify because here a colour image is converting into its black & white sketch by using libraries like OpenCV and Imageio.
